mpdg15 is a simple Music Player Daemon frontend for G15Daemon, and is
written completely in python. It includes also custom-made g15 drawing
library, since i didn't like the available "official" one.

Dependencies:
	python2				-	of course, it is written in python
	python-mpd			-	these are the uesd mpd bindings
	python-bitarray		-	used heavily for drawing operations
	python-pyalsaaudio	-	system main volume is fetched with this
	python-daemon		-	daemonatization is done with this
